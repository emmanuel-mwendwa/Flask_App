This flask app is based on the book "Flask Web Development Developing Web Applications with Python" by Miguel Grinberg

I am learning the basics of Flask and Python Backend developing.
How an application processes data from database and how it is displayed in the web.

I hope by the end of this journey I will be a proficient Backend Developer.
I hope to develop more apps and to never quit in this journey of Web Developing till I am a certified engineer.
